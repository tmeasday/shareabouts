    <strong>Sweet Spot</strong> - Have you found the perfect post ride three quarter latte? Are the eggs at this spot worth a long ride? Where is your favourite place to dock those tired legs and knock the top off a cold one? Share your favourite rider friendly café, bar, restaurant or any spot with good grub or good times for thirsty folk.

    <strong>Hot Spot</strong> - In every corner of Melbourne there is some two-wheeled action brewing. This city is a veritable hot pot of great spots to do something new on your bike. Rides, tours, games, demonstrations, competitions, classes – you name it, it’s probably happening more often and closer than you think. If it’s in your calendar – stop hogging the good stuff! Share your hot city spot with the rest of us.

    <strong>Beauty Spot</strong> - The winding path opened around the luscious green bend of the valley… The sea breeze lapped at your collar…the light reflected luminously along the elegant building’s expanse… Have you found heaven on your pushie? A feast for the eyes is all the more delicious when shared. You can’t hide a beauty spot for long. Maybe we’ll meet you there?

    <strong>Shop Spot</strong> - Jeepers creepers where’d you get that? For every person that rides there is a bike riding with them, and sometimes a whole lot more. Where is your favourite spot to stock up on the things you need for your life in the bike lane? It might be a shopfront, it might be a market, it might be some guy’s backyard – but if we can get it too – drop a pin on it.

    <strong>Organisation Spot</strong> - There are so many groups and organisations working tirelessly to make life better. Give them some recognition by pinning an Organisation Spot on their location.
